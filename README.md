THIS SCRIPT determines if two alleles are significantly differentially translated given polysome profiling followed by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) data.<br/>

Input file specifications: the input file should be a summary of the data generated by ddPCR, represented as a table. The rows will correspond to each sample run through the ddPCR (usually each fraction from the polysome profiling is done with 3-4 replicates). There will be 4 columns, each corresponding to one quadrant of a ddPCR plot (Ch1+/Ch2+, Ch1+/Ch2-, Ch1-/Ch2+, Ch1-/Ch2-, with each channel (Ch1 or Ch2) containing the probe for either the mutant or the wildtype allele.

There are two required arguments:<br/>
1) ```--filename``` = the name of the input ddPCR file
2) ```--expected_ratios``` = expected mutant/wildtype ratio (usually 1.0 for a diploid heterozygote)<br/>

Optional arguments include:<br/>
1) ```--fractions```: a vector that specifies whether the groups analyzed will be the individual fractions or groups based on<br/> number of ribosomes<br/>

Default value = ```NULL``` (groups generated will correspond to each individual polysome fraction)<br/>
If a vector is specified, then the individual fractions will be further grouped based on number of ribosomes. Note that the vecotr has to be comma separated (i.e. ```7,3,1,1,1,5```). <br/>

2) ```--nsims```: the number of bootstrap simulations performed <br/>
    Default value = ```1000```<br/>

3) ```--output```: filename of the output file (where the generated pvalues are)<br/>
    Default value = ```"output.csv"```, located in the same directory as this script<br/>

Example use case (run in command line): ```Rscript thisScript.R --filename path/to/filename --expected_ratios 1.0 --nsims 10000 --output path/to/desiredoutputfile ```

* Add a directory called example that would be the positive control test case. <br/>
